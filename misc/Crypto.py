#PEcrypt - use a string key to encrypt/decrypt another string

class PEcrypt:
    """
    PEcrypt - very, very simple word key encryption system
              uses cyclic XOR between the keyword character
              bytes and the string to be encrypted/decrypted.
              Therefore, the same function and keyword will
              encrypt the string the first time and decrypt
              it if called on the encrypted string.
